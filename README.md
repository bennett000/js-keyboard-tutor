Piano Typing Tutor
==================

When I was a child my school's computer network had "typing tutor" software 
installed on it.  This software helped me learn to type as a child, and I'm 
assuming that similar software could help me learn to play the piano.  There
may already be existing software out there that fills this purpose, but to my
knowledge, none of it is FLOSS; plus I'm hoping this can be a fun project to
relax with on the week-ends.
